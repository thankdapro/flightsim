# Island Flight Simulator

A browser flight simulator you can install and play offline. Take off from
Kestrel Island, learn to fly in the tutorial, complete three missions, and land
in anything from a blue-bird day to a thunderstorm.

Built with three.js. **Every texture and every sound in the game is generated in
code at load time** — there are no image or audio files to download, which is why
the whole thing is a few hundred kilobytes and works identically offline.

---

## Running it locally

The game is made of ES modules, so it must be served over HTTP. Opening
`index.html` straight from Finder or Explorer will **not** work — browsers block
module imports from `file://` URLs.

**Easiest way** (Python 3 is pre-installed on macOS and Linux):

```bash
python3 serve.py
```

That starts a server on <http://localhost:8807> and opens your browser. Press
Ctrl+C to stop it. To use a different port: `python3 serve.py 3000`.

**With Node.js instead:**

```bash
npx serve .
# or
npx http-server -p 8807
```

**With any other web server:** point it at this folder. No build step, no
`npm install`, no bundler — the files are served exactly as they are.

Requires a browser with WebGL 2: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari 16+.

## Installing it as an app (offline play)

1. Open the game in Chrome or Edge.
2. Click **Install / Download game** on the start screen, or use the install
   icon in the address bar.
3. On iPhone/iPad: Share → *Add to Home Screen*.

Once installed it runs from your dock or home screen in its own window and works
with no internet connection at all. The service worker (`sw.js`) caches every
file on first load, so even without installing, a second visit works offline.

## Controls

| Action | Keys |
| --- | --- |
| Pitch down / up | `W` / `S` |
| Roll left / right | `A` / `D` |
| Rudder left / right | `Q` / `E` |
| More power / less power | `Shift` / `Ctrl` (or `↑` / `↓`) |
| Wheel brakes | `Space` |
| Landing gear | `G` |
| Flaps down / up | `F` / `V` |
| Start / stop engine | `I` |
| Change camera | `C` |
| Look behind | `B` (hold) |
| Release cargo | `X` |
| Show controls | `H` |
| Mute | `M` |
| Pause | `Esc` |

Every key can be reassigned in **Settings → Controls**. Mouse flying and
gamepads are supported too (Settings → Flying).

**How do I slow down?** Hold `Ctrl` (or `↓`) to reduce power. `Space` is the
wheel brakes and only works on the ground. `F` lowers the flaps, which lets you
fly slowly on the approach.

## What is in the game

- **Tutorial** — nine guided steps from starting the engine to landing.
- **Island Circuit** — take off, fly five checkpoint rings, land.
- **Mango Cay Delivery** — carry supplies 8 km, parachute them onto a target, come home.
- **Storm Approach** — a 24 kt crosswind landing in a thunderstorm.
- **Free Flight** — any time of day, any weather, any wind.

Weather covers midday / sunset / night crossed with clear / cloudy / rainy /
stormy, with adjustable wind speed and direction, real crosswind effects,
turbulence, gusts, drifting clouds and lightning.

Two flight models: **simplified** (the aeroplane levels its wings, holds its
height, coordinates the rudder and refuses to stall) and **realistic** (all of
that switched off).

## Running the self-test

The game ships with a headless test suite that flies it for you — take-off,
climb, turns, stalls, landings in calm air and in an 18 kt crosswind with rain,
all twelve weather combinations, every camera, the tutorial, all three missions,
save data and the offline plumbing.

Open the game, then in the browser console:

```js
const { runSelfTest } = await import('./tests/selftest.js');
const results = await runSelfTest(window.__sim);
console.table(results.checks);
```

`window.__sim` also exposes `step(seconds)`, `snapshot()`, `key(code, down)` and
`override` for driving the simulator by hand.

## Licence

Code and generated assets: **CC0 1.0** (public domain) — copy it, change it,
share it, use it in your own projects.

Bundled three.js (`src/vendor/three.module.js`) remains under its own **MIT**
licence; the full text is in `src/vendor/three.LICENSE`.

Full asset-by-asset credits are in the in-game **Credits & licences** screen.

### A note on the ATC voices

There is no text-to-speech and no AI-generated voice anywhere in this game, and
no voice recordings are bundled. The radio calls are indistinct formant-filtered
chatter — the acoustic shape of speech without any words — pushed through a
realistic radio chain (300–2800 Hz band, soft clipping, squelch bursts, relay
clicks, heterodyne interference and dropouts). The words themselves are shown as
subtitles.

If you want to add genuine public-domain or properly licensed recordings of real
human voices, put the files in `assets/atc/`, list each one with its creator,
licence and source URL in `src/ui/credits.js`, and add the filenames to
`PRECACHE` in `sw.js` so they stay available offline.
